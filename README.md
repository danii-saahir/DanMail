# DanMail
PHP mass mailer with multi-recipient sending.

## Usage
- Install anywhere.
- Ensure the server has SMTP or PHP 'mail' configured.
- Optionally, customize the configuration for server configuration check info to send to your email (Or just leave as is, doesn't actually needed to change). You can also change your default password 'danmail' to anything you want.

## Features
- Use any email
- Input sanitization.
- Great UI on mobile and desktop.
- Multiple recipient support.
- Mass mailing.
- SMTP, PHP `mail()` configuration check.

## Future Plans

## Caution
Be mindful that recipients can potentially trace your server's IP via EML. Use responsibly; I'm not liable for any damages.
